<h3 class="category">Prospective PhD students</h3>
<mark><b>I'm looking to hire several PhD students to start in Fall 2024.</b></mark> If you'd like to work with me, apply directly to the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions">CS department</a> and mention my name in your application. I look forward to talking to you once you are admitted!

<p>
The PhD program is fully funded (check out an estimate of the CS stipends vs. cost of living in Ithaca <a href="https://csstipendrankings.org/">here</a>), but I also recommend all PhD students to apply to graduate fellowships since this will give you more flexibility throughout your PhD. For domestic students, the most common fellowships are the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF GRFP</a> and the <a href = "https://ndseg.org/">NDSEG</a>. For a broader list of fellowships, please see <a href = "https://gradschool.cornell.edu/financial-support/fellowships/">Cornell's page on graduate fellowships</a> and this <a href = "https://github.com/chinasaokolo/csGraduateFellowships">curated list of CS fellowships</a>.  </p>
<h3 class="category">Prospective Postdocs</h3>
<p>
Excellent postdoctoral candidates are encouraged to email me with the subject line including the words <b>"Prospective Postdoc"</b> to discuss current openings. In your email please include: 
	<ul>
	  <li>Your CV with a publication list</li>
	  <li>Short description of past and future research interests</li>
	  <li>Names and contact info of 2 academic references</li>
	</ul>
	
I encourage you to apply for a postdoctoral fellowship and am happy to work with you on this. <br><br> </p>
